Hey!

Quick update: **Cite-Agent v1.5.7 just dropped** with formatting fixes that make everything look way better.

## The Fix in 10 Seconds

**Before:**
```
Mean: 120.0000, Revenue: 1234567890, P/E: $\boxed{15.5000}$
```

**After:**
```
Mean: 120, Revenue: 1,234,567,890, P/E: 15.5
```

That's it. Numbers look like numbers. No decimal spam, no LaTeX weirdness, no random backticks.

## What Changed

Three fixes:
1. **Smart number formatting** - integers stay integers, big numbers get commas
2. **Killed LaTeX notation** - no more `$\boxed{}$` in your terminal
3. **Cleaned markdown artifacts** - stripped stray backticks

Everything just looks cleaner now.

## Quick Reminder: What Cite-Agent Does

Your terminal research assistant that actually works:

**Search 200M+ papers** → "Find papers on transformer architecture"  
**Live financial data** → "What's Tesla's Q3 revenue?"  
**Instant data analysis** → "Load sales.csv and show trends"  
**Fact-check anything** → "Is water's boiling point 100°C?"

No browser tabs. No API docs. Just ask.

## Why This Release Matters

These formatting issues were small but annoying—the kind that make you wince every time you see `.0000` on an integer or random LaTeX notation in your output.

Now it's fixed. Everything's cleaner. That's the whole release.
